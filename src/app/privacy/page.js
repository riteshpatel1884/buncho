        This Privacy Policy explains what information Buncho collects, how we
        use it, and the choices you have.

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address and

          answers, bookmarks and progress.

          processed by your browser&apos;s built-in speech recognition. Buncho
          does not store your audio; only the resulting text that you submit
          is saved.

          analytics tools described below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preferences:</strong> for example, your light or dark theme
          choice, stored in your browser.

      <h2>5. Public content</h2>

        We use cookies and local storage for sign-in, security and saving
        your preferences (such as theme). Google Analytics also uses cookies
        to measure site usage. You can block or delete cookies in your
        browser settings, though some features may stop working.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data retention and deletion</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your data while your account is active. You can request

        retained where the law requires.

        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect

        guarantee absolute security.

        Buncho is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child
